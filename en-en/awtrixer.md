with AWTRIXER you can create 8x8 icons (static or animated) and 32x8 animations
AWTRIXER is based on [Piskel](https://www.piskelapp.com/) and works directly with the AWTRIX backend.
AWTRIXER contains a lot of functions that almost remind of Photoshop.

!> Piskel and therefore AWTRIXER are not optimized for mobile devices!
