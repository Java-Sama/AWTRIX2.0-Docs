# Here we go!

You built the matrix and installed the host? Now we can move on to the more pleasant part.
AWTRIX is mainly controlled by a web interface. By default this can be accessed via the following URL:
``` URL
http:// [HOST-IP]:7000/
```

AWTRIX welcomes you with a modern and easy to understand interface

On the main page you will find some important information like available app updates and if your matrix is connected to the host.

Furthermore you have the possibility to test the API Tester and get to know the big [API documentation](/en-en/api).

On the left hand side you will always find the sidebar which allows you to navigate to all functions of AWTRIX.

The web interface is also optimized for smartphones and can even be installed as a webapp on your home screen.
To do so, go to the page on your smartphone, open the browser settings and click "Add to homescreen". AWTRIX will look like a real app!
